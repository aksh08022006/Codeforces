# Codeforces Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various Codeforces problems.

## Directory Structure

- `solutions/`: This directory contains all the solution files. Each solution is stored in a separate file named after the problem ID.

## Adding a New Solution

To add a new solution, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in the `solutions/` directory.
2. Use the `solution_template.cpp` file as a template for your solution.
3. Name the file after the problem ID (e.g., `1234.cpp` for problem 1234).
4. Commit and push the changes to the repository.

## Solution Template

Use the following template for your solutions:

````cpp
/* 
Problem ID: [Problem ID]
Problem Name: [Problem Name]
Problem URL: [Problem URL]
*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Your solution code goes here

    return 0;
}
